# Snake-Game
This is a simple Snake Game built using Java. Control the snake to eat the food, grow longer, and avoid hitting the walls or itself.

**Features**
1. Classic snake game mechanics.
2. Dynamic food generation.
3. Simple text-based interface.
**How to Play**
1. Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA).
2. Run the SnakeGame class to start the game.
3. Use the following keys to control the snake:
4. U for Up
   D for Down
   R for Right
   L for Left
5. The game ends when the snake hits a wall or itself.
How It Works
1. The snake moves in the direction you choose.
2. If the snake eats the food (X), it grows longer, and new food is generated.
3. If the snake doesn't eat the food, it remains the same size.
4. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
